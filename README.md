# Project Name: Hacker News Search

## Description
This project is a React web application that allows users to search for posts on Hacker News and view details about each post.

## Features
- **Home Screen**: The home screen features a search field at the top and a list of search results below the search field. When a query is entered in the search field, the search results API is triggered and the list of search results is populated below.
- **Post Detail Screen**: Clicking on a search result navigates the user to the post detail screen where the details of the selected post are displayed. The details are fetched by calling the Get item API using the objectID obtained from the search results.
- **APIs Used**: The application uses the Hacker News Search API to fetch the search results and post details.
